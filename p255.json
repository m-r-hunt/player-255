      "notes": "Phantom Hourglass is a Zelda game, really well made in general but it has a few issues.\r\n\r\nThere\u0027s a bit of an overemphasis on using the DS\u0027s (at the time) new and unique hardware features. Touch-based controls and drawing on the map are fine, but the use of microphone and closing the DS lid(!) is kind of gratuitous.\r\n\r\nDungeon design is not at its best. It always feels like you\u0027re a bit on-rails and can just go with the flow, complete each room, and get through the dungeon without *really* engaging the brain. There\u0027s no real killer dungeon with a large scale puzzle to solve.\r\n\r\nThen there\u0027s the Temple of the Ocean King. Repeated trips retreading the same ground and bad stealth mechanics make the Temple feel like a real roadbump when you\u0027re otherwise having a good time with the game. And that\u0027s not to mention the Ghost Ship combining \u0022stealth\u0022 with escorting  slow-walking NPCs.\r\n\r\nAll that complaining knocks Phantom Hourglass down to a 4/5.",

      "notes": "Phantom Hourglass, the previous game, is a game that really leans into the DS\u0027s hardware and as a result plays out very differently from the GBA Zelda titles (e.g. Minish Cap). Yoshi\u0027s Island DS represents the far opposite end of the spectrum, and plays out almost identically to Yoshi\u0027s Island on the GBA. This is interesting as it sets boundaries most DS sequels fall somewhere in between. Some of them are mostly the same with touch screen menus or minor enhancements, and some lean more towards changing it up (but few as drastically as PH).\r\n\r\nAlmost all the action takes place on one screen, with the other extending the field of view up or down (and you can switch which way you\u0027re looking at will). The graphics are upgraded a little from the GBA title but much in the same style, and the gameplay is basically identical.\r\n\r\nThe one major new mechanic is swapping babies. Different babies have different abilities which change up the gameplay a little bit, and you have to swap around occaisionally to solve puzzles. I mostly stuck with Mario when I had a choice as he\u0027s the most versatible.\r\n\r\nA lot of stuff is returning from the previous game. Nothing is directly copied over I think, but the early game seems familiar and there are some things like a boss that\u0027s a remix of a boss from YIGBA. A few segments are very closely borrowed from the first game like one falling rock section. There\u0027s not much outside of the baby mechanic sections that couldn\u0027t have gone in the original game.\r\n\r\nThe sped up the transformation animation which is a minor thing but really annoyed me in the previous game because it was so slow.\r\n\r\nWeird observation: in the original YI after beating a boss you get a big key and open an invisible door to the next world. In this one the key is gone but the door is now visible with a big keyhole.\r\n\r\nI think the game gets kind of bullshit and frustrating towards the end. For some reason they decided the ice world was one that needed bringing back for round 2 as well.\r\n\r\nOverall Yoshi\u0027s Island is solid but feels like it\u0027s mostly a rehash of the original with small tweaks and additions. My enjoyment of it definitely suffered because I\u0027ve only recently played the GBA version.\r\n",

      "notes": "Well I rambled last time about the extremes of DS game ports and the randomizer gods have given me a third interesting data point. Etrian Odyssey is fairly unique as a game that only works as well as it does on the DS, without feeling like a gimmicky use of hardware. Having seperate touch screen and main screen provides the perfect setup for dungeon crawling on the top while mapping on the bottom, and buttons provide the controls you want for the gameplay.\r\n\r\nEtrian Odyssey is a harsh game. Particularly during the first few levels you can easily have a character die or even wipe out if you get unlucky in a single fight. I used emulator save states to smooth this out a bit with extra checkpoints and it improved my experience a lot I think.\r\n\r\nThere are a lot of quality of life features missing from EO1 that must have been added in later games. A lot of the menus are a little clunky, and you can\u0027t even sidestep with the shoulder buttons.\r\n\r\nThe structure of the game is one giant 25 floor dungeon which you progress through pretty linearly. Each 5 floors there\u0027s a boss and then a convenient fast travel point. You do end up retreading floors quite a few times, which gets a little annoying but it does line up with encouraging you to map carefully, so I\u0027m not sure how I feel about it. Interestingly if you die in the dungeon it\u0027s a hard game over, but you do get to save your map data.\r\n\r\nThe game basically needs to balance on a knife edge in order to create a satisfying challenge without falling into being frustrating. I think it mostly succeeds, although the early game can be rough and the balance of different classes isn\u0027t 100% dialled in.\r\n\r\nThere\u0027s a bunch of stuff that\u0027s janky, and the balance of classes isn\u0027t great. I looked up some tips online and that gave me a relatively smooth experience but without that you could easily end up with a dead end party.\r\n\r\nThe environment design gets a little stale. On the one hand, having a giant forest dungeon is fairly unique. Unfortunately the game goes with \u0022forest\u0022, \u0022dense forst\u0022, \u0022blue forest\u0022, \u0022sandy desert forest\u0022 making up the environments for most of the game. To be fair, the 5th stratum does change it up fairly dramatically (with a little bit of forest vibes remaining).\r\n\r\nThe mapping tools are a touch lacking in this installment. In particular one stage is effectively a conveyor belt maze and there\u0027s no way to notate the conveyors. A few other icons in certain places would have gone a long way too.\r\n\r\nThe story is quite light for most of the game but really kicks into high gear right near the end.\r\n\r\nThe final boss is kind of bullshit, and beating it seemed to require a ton of grinding and possibly rejigging my party significantly. I ended up using cheats to get over the line, no regrets.\r\n\r\nOverall, I think Etrian Odyssey manages to pull it off. It has a lot of issues but the core game is there and is good. It went on a little too long but not so long that I rage quit. I know that when we get all the way to the later 3DS titles massive improvements have been made, so I\u0027m interested to find out how the series evolves over 2 and 3 which are part of the DS challenge list.\r\n",

      "notes": "Hotel Dusk is somewhere between a visual novel and a point-and-click adventure game.\r\nIt\u0027s another DS title making some interesting use of the hardware: it\u0027s one of the handful of games that are played with the DS held sideways, \u0022like a book\u0022.\r\nIt uses the touch screen almost exclusively with the only use of buttons to advance text when no other input is needed.\r\n\r\nThe game has not one but two puzzles which hinge on closing the DS lid!\r\nI thought Phantom Hourglass was the only one!\r\nAnother weird hardware thing: there\u0027s a puzzle where you have to press two switches at once.\r\nBut the DS doesn\u0027t support multi-touch, pressing multiple points reads as the average location.\r\nSo the game expects to read you pressing one switch and then jumping to half way between them.\r\nThis was possible on the emulator by manipulating the pause function while moving the touch point.\r\nWeird hack though.\r\n\r\nI said it\u0027s part visual novel because there is a lot of text and dialog.\r\nI got a bit frustrated as the text scrolls in slowly, with no option to speed it up or press a button to advance.\r\nIt\u0027s not voiced, so this just pads out the game when you can read text quicker than that.\r\nI nearly always have text speed set to as fast as possible in games, I\u0027m not sure I know anyone who has it on slower speeds given the choice.\r\n\r\nThere\u0027s a system in the dialog where you can sometimes interrupt when prompted to ask a question.\r\nThis system seemed a bit redundant as I basically always pressed it when given the option, and I think sometimes it would be required to get key dialog.\r\nAlso it always gives you an option of 2 questions but it\u0027s often not clear from the prompt what you\u0027re asking or how the two options actually differ.\r\nIf you fuck up and choose the wrong prompt you\u0027ll often \u0022remember it\u0022 5 seconds after you leave the conversation allowing you to have another swing.\r\nThat\u0027s just annoying really.\r\n\r\nThe point-and-click adventure aspect is fairly light, mainly walking around to find people to talk to with occaisional simple puzzles.\r\nIt keeps it pretty grounded compared to more comedic or out-there adventure games.\r\nMore \u0022find a wire to pick this lock\u0022 than \u0022use this rubber chicked to cross a zipline\u0022.\r\nThere are some touch screen minigames, which work OK aside from a few fiddly ones.\r\n\r\nGraphically the game is pretty good.\r\nThere\u0027s a good mix of static 3D environments that you wander around and this sketchy hand-drawn style for dialog.\r\nCutscenes also make good use of the two screens side-by-side with effects that cross over or with characters facing each other.\r\n\r\nSo a lot of the game rests on the story.\r\nIt\u0027s kind of a noir detective style story.\r\nThe main character, Kyle Hyde, is an ex-NYPD cop who\u0027s looking for a former partner.\r\nHe turns up at the titular Hotel Dusk, and over the course of a single night you uncover the mysteries of his past which turn out to be conveniently linked to a bunch of people at the hotel.\r\nIt\u0027s really a slow burner and fairly focused on characters rather than a wild plot.\r\n\r\nThis game takes a while to get going.\r\nThe main character also has the classic \u0022video game protagonist\u0022 personality where he pokes and pries into everything for no apparent reason, and engages in casual theft, breaking and entering rather than just asking for a hand like a normal human being.\r\nYou spend a fair amount of time early in the game doing fairly boring stuff, like \u0022have dinner\u0022, \u0022find your package that\u0027s been misdelivered\u0022, and \u0022pay your hotel bill\u0022.\r\nI thought the game might kick it up into high gear later but no, past half way in the game and we\u0027re still doing \u0022figure out what wine someone had with dinner so you can give them the label they wanted\u0022.\r\nI keep waiting for a dramatic inciting incident like a murder which has never come.\r\n\r\nThe dialog slips into really exagerated noir detective lingo at times.\r\n\r\nThe climactic puzzle is kind of dumb since it requires you to solve it within a time limit as you\u0027re locked in an airtight room.\r\nBut then solving the puzzle doesn\u0027t let you exit, someone else arbitrarily saves you.\r\nThe whole plot reveals in the last few chapters revolve around the fact the bad guys have hidden elaborate puzzles hiding their secrets in the hotel rather than just... not writing them down anywhere.\r\n\r\nUltimately Hotel Dusk fell a bit flat for me and I wanted to get it over with.\r\nThe story is about equivalent to a single Phoenix Wright case but it\u0027s stretched to an entire game.\r\nThe focus is more on realistic characters but none of them are that interesting or well written.\r\nI can imagine a version of this game that\u0027s good, but Hotel Dusk doesn\u0027t quite get there.\r\n",

      "notes": "Touch Detective is a pretty straight point and click adventure title. It\u0027s one of the lowest metacritic rated games, but I stuck it in (along with the sequel) as I\u0027ve played bits before and I wanted to have a go at experiencing it properly.\r\n\r\nWeak use of DS features generally. Plays out almost entirely on the touch screen with touch based gameplay, but the top screen is almost entirely unused. Basically just has a close up of the main character reacting to events and a label telling you where you are.\r\n\r\nThe gameplay is simple point and click stuff, talk to people (with simple dialogue trees and short conversations), find and examine items, combine them together, and use them to solve puzzles in the world. The design goes off the rails very quickly, and even the first case descends into literal dream logic which makes almost no sense. There doesn\u0027t seem to be a way to solve a lot of things in the game without a lot of trial and error or guide usage. There\u0027s also some acausal behaviour where a character won\u0027t appear to advance the plot unless you\u0027ve hit the right arbitrary triggers to continue.\r\n\r\nStorywise, you play as a young girl who\u0027s inherited her family\u0027s detective agency, and you need to solve 4 cases to be recognised by the Great Detective Society. You proceed to solve the requesite 4 cases at which point the game ends. Nothing too wild going on there but it\u0027s an excuse to have some episodic mysteries to solve.\r\n\r\nGraphically and thematically I quite like the game. It\u0027s got this \u0022dark cartoon\u0022, almost Tim Burtonish style to it which I think works. The story and cases are mostly cute and innocent with surreal twists to them.\r\n\r\nThe game is pretty short with the 4 cases taking roughly the same amount of time rather than lengthening later on. There are only a handful of areas in the game too (even compared to Hotel Dusk\u0027s tiny hotel last time).\r\n\r\nOne particular dialog broke my mind. The \u0022correct solution\u0022 was to say \u0022no\u0022 when asked if you know who did it. Then after a few lines of dialog the main character says they do know who did it and you get to pick from a list of options. wat. That made no sense at all. That was in the 4th case, which might be the most nonsensical of all, with the Circus Master who is like an insane dementia case and the culprit who just pops up and admits it once you\u0027ve smashed your head into a wall.\r\n\r\nOverall, a bit of a lacklustre adventure game, slightly saved by its general style.\r\n",

So here it is, a few games later, thanks RNGesus.\r\n\r\nIt\u0027s a kind of arcade-style action game. It\u0027s split into 2 \u0022phases\u0022. In the first, Baby Mario descends on the top screen and you have to anticipate his fall and draw cloud platforms on the touch screen to guide him past enemies and into coins to score points. Enemies can also be circled to turn them into bubbles which can then be thrown around. Everything is a bit physicsy as Mario, the enemies and coins are all affected by your cloud platforms.\r\n\r\nThen it moves to Yoshi carrying Baby Mario horizontally. You can still draw clouds to move Yoshi around, but mainly you tap to throw eggs at enemies across both screens.\r\n\r\nThe game is just a score attack driven game, with a few modes that vary slightly in how long you play and what the goal is. There\u0027s no way to get to the credits or \u0022beat the game\u0022 that I could see (apart from beating all the built-in high scores). I put it down after playing enough to get a sense of it. Didn\u0027t fall in love with the gameplay, but it\u0027s OK.\r\n",

      "notes": "Ninja Gaiden: Dragon Sword is an adaptation of the Ninja Gaiden series for the DS. Specifically the later 3D Ninja Gaiden games that are more like spectacle fighters rather than the original 2D platformers.\r\n\r\nNinja Gaiden: Dragon Sword is our first instance of contrived subtitles that abbreviate to DS - Ninja Gaiden: Dragon Sword = NG:DS. We\u0027ll be seeing plenty of them in the DS challenge.\r\n\r\nWhen playing, you have the DS oriented sideways again, and control mostly using the touch screen. Touch to run around, slash or tap enemies to attack them, etc. Press any physical button to block. There are some special moves on specific gesture sequences too.\r\n\r\nThe game has some really cool elements like boss fights with big boss enemies and the camera shifting to a closer in perspective. Boss fights felt dramatic and fun generally. The special magic moves feel really powerful and cool to fire off, although the \u0022draw the symbol\u0022 minigame was a bit pointless since you\u0027re not timed or risking damage as you do it.\r\n\r\nThere are some criticisms to make. A lot of the time I felt like I was doing the touch screen equivalent of button mashing and doing just fine in combat.\r\n\r\nCombat also gets fairly repetetive quickly as you\u0027re almost always fighting really large waves of the same few enemy types. Seriously, almost every room will have wave after wave of enemies spawning. I got into the habit of running through a lot of rooms where the fight wasn\u0027t mandatory to progress. Enemy variety over the whole game is ok, but each level only has 3-4 types of enemies present so they get stale within each level.\r\n\r\nOh I should probably mention the game has a story. It\u0027s nothing to write home about, big boobed demon ladies are messing things up and kidnapping your (love interest or sister) (I missed which one it was) and you (a ninja) have to collect some mcguffins and then use the titular Dragon Sword to stop them. It\u0027s an excuse to murder a bunch of demons and enemy ninjas.\r\n\r\nThe game isn\u0027t too tough, there are plenty of save points that fill up your health and magic, and I was able to plough through the game without many deaths. The bosses get tougher later on though.\r\n\r\nHonestly NG:DS exceeded the expectations I formed after I assessed what kind of game it was. It plays out better than I would have thought \u0022spectacle fighter using touch controls\u0022 would. I think it might have ended up better if they had just gone with classic button controls and could have made the game feel tighter and more precise.\r\n",

      "notes": "Advance Wars Dual Strike is a very straight adaptation of Advance Wars onto the DS. You have the option to use touch screen controls but that\u0027s it really.\r\n\r\nThe core gameplay is the same as the classic Advance Wars formula. What they\u0027ve done is *even more* of the stuff we saw in AW2 on GBA: more COs, more units including a super-super-heavy tank and some whacky stuff like stealth bombers, more weird Black Hole structures and mission objectives. I think the game is almost buckling under the weight of all this stuff, but it just about manages to hold up.\r\n\r\nThe big new thing is having a tag team of 2 COs, either split across two fronts or alternating turns on a single battlefield. This leads to the new double-super CO power where you get to use both super powers and take 2 turns in a row. This mechanic is insanely swingy as taking 2 turns and getting 2 powers is ridiculous. It\u0027s a combination of demoralising and annoying when the AI does it as you have to sit through 2 turns of getting hammered extra hard, and they nearly always get to use theirs first because it charges up faster when you\u0027re losing units. I\u0027m not very convinced this adds a lot to the game.\r\n\r\nAnother problem is that remembering all the factors involved in damage calculation makes it a lot harder to predict the outcome of any given battle, which should be a core part of AW gameplay. You\u0027ve got 8 different COs interacting with their abilities modifying things, terrain, Com Tower buffs, and a lot more types of units in the mix. It\u0027s just a mess really, and detracts from what I see as the tight strategy core of AW as a series.\r\n\r\nI still hate fog of war missions.\r\n\r\nI think the campaign is tuned to be kind of easy. I certainly found myself walking through missions for a long time. In general it felt like as long as you went with a vaguely reasonable strategy victory was pretty inevitable. There is a hard campaign so maybe that is tuned to be more challenging.\r\n\r\nA lot of the time I felt that starting missions was a big roadblock. Especially later in the game where the missions become big and complicated, with you controlling 3 factions with 2 COs each, I just found myself struggling to find the energy to start missions.\r\n\r\nOverall the core of Advance Wars is the solid strategy game it\u0027s always been, but it\u0027s grown out of control and too bombastic in this installment. The bigger and more elaborate the maps get, the harder I find it to keep playing, and I ultimately decided to put this down.\r\n",

      "notes": "So Puchi Puchi Virus is firmly in the \u0022I had no idea what this game was\u0022 category. It\u0027s an arcadey puzzle game where you have to form triangles of coloured viruses on a hex grid, and set off big chain reactions to score big points.\r\n\r\nThe core mechanic is OK, but not quite good enough to really warrant as much game as we got here.\r\n\r\nThe story and writing were surprisingly good, with a solid dose of weird humour and a few references thrown in. Each \u0022patient\u0022/level has a few lines and a backstory thrown in for good measure, and the cutscenes that break up the gameplay were kind of funny.\r\n\r\nThe game is strutured around 102 patients (levels) which you have to cure 90 of to finish the game. Each one has a unique win condition, except there\u0027s a lot of \u0022the same one but with different numbers\u0022. Almost all of them are just \u0022score x points in 3 minutes\u0022 or \u0022create x chains of length y\u0022. It gets pretty repetetive. Also, late on the game stopped giving me cases and I had to figure out that randomly playing practice mode would unlock the last few cases.\r\n\r\nI burned through Puchi Puchi Virus pretty fast, I had some fun with it but I can\u0027t see myself playing it again.",

      "notes": "Professor Layton and the Subtitle Part 1 is a puzzle game with a much better claim to that genre name than most other \u0022puzzle\u0022 games.\r\n\r\nThe core gameplay is, well, puzzle solving. When I say puzzles, I mean mostly riddles and some touch screen based sliding puzzles and similar. The key is variety and almost all the puzzles are actually unique riddles with only a few variations on a theme. These are well done, with solid explanations (so they are actually possible to get without guessing), a hint system for when you\u0027re stuck, and nice interfaces to take notes or play with the puzzle pieces. Answers are generally entered by either circling or touching an answer, or a handwriting recognition system for numbers/letters that works pretty decently.\r\n\r\nA few puzzles don\u0027t land, which is inevitable really given the number in the game.\r\n\r\nYou get a score for each puzzle in \u0022Picarats\u0022 and picking the wrong answer for a puzzle will reduce your reward when you finally get it right. This is persistent through the whole game so any wrong answer reduces your theoretically maximum score for completeing all puzzles. It\u0027s best not to think too hard about this and just play the game.\r\n\r\nTo get hints in puzzles you need hint coins, which are found by clicking the background in the adventure screens and are a finite supply throughout the whole game. However I found that as long as you\u0027re not hitting hints constantly it\u0027s not really a problem to get one when you need it.\r\n\r\nThe actual puzzles are tied together by a light adventure/visual novelly gameplay where you wander around the titular village, talking to people and finding puzzles to solve. There\u0027s generally not much \u0022point and click adventure\u0022 style puzzle solving to do, instead you just transition to a discrete puzzle when it\u0027s time for some gameplay.\r\n\r\nThere are a few minigames where you find objects as rewards for solving puzzles and slowly get to reassemble a painting/robot/decorate your rooms. These are nice distractions and get completed at different rates as you play the game.\r\n\r\nThe game has a story which is kind of a quirky mystery that unfolds as you wander around and solve puzzles. It\u0027s not the most incredible writing but it keeps the pace up and there is some motivation to see how all the mysteries the game piles on will resolve themselves. The cast of puzzle obssessed weirdos occupying the village are kind of endearing in their way too.\r\n\r\nIt\u0027s also got quite nicely animated cutscenes that match the rest of the game art, although they do look a bit compressed on the DS.\r\n\r\nThe critical path through the games (in terms of puzzle count) is relatively short, but I did click around and find most of the optional puzzles, because I do enjoy solving them. There are times where the game checks how many puzzles you\u0027ve solved but I never had a problem with passing those.\r\n\r\nNotes on the ending: the deceased baron was a crazy person who should not have been allowed custody of his daughter.\r\n\r\nOverall I really like Professor Layton games. They are just nice and relaxing to play. There\u0027s not much chance of getting significantly stuck given the built-in hint system, looking up a walkthrough is almost never required. There are a lot of iterations in the challenge list, so it is possible I\u0027ll get sick of them by the end (I think my new randomizer which will space them out will help a lot with this though). Also interested to see if they get changed up at all.\r\n",

      "notes": "Yup, Plants Vs Zombies, remember that game from pop culture circa the late 2000s? This is a DS port of the PC version, and it\u0027s pretty fully featured. Minimal usage of the DS\u0027s unique features, touch controls to replace mouse controls and the top screen displays some basic UI elements. If you\u0027re not familiar, this is a tower defence game where you grow plants to repel waves of zombies.\r\n\r\nThe game is fundamentally pretty fun. There\u0027s a continual trickle of new plants to use on each stage, and every 10 stages things get changed up significantly (night time, backyard with pool, etc). It\u0027s about the right length too, with 5x10 level stages, things never quite get boring.\r\n\r\nThe game isn\u0027t too hard. As long as you focus on building up your economy (sun generation) early and deploy plants that work against the enemies when necessary, things aren\u0027t too hard. Also the basic \u0022big explosion one-use plant\u0022 remained the most reliable ally throughout the entire game really.\r\n\r\nThe \u0022night, fog and water\u0022 levels got a bit obnoxious. You have to take so many utility plants to deal with the stuff, you can\u0027t build up your economy really well, and some of the enemies are also horrible to deal with.\r\n\r\nThe DS assets are obviously slightly lower resolution than some version, and it does suffer from a lot of lag a lot of the time when things get intense. Other than that, decent port.\r\n\r\nOverall, pretty fun, if getting a little repetetive near the end.\r\n",
