      "notes": "Phantom Hourglass is a Zelda game, really well made in general but it has a few issues.\r\n\r\nThere\u0027s a bit of an overemphasis on using the DS\u0027s (at the time) new and unique hardware features. Touch-based controls and drawing on the map are fine, but the use of microphone and closing the DS lid(!) is kind of gratuitous.\r\n\r\nDungeon design is not at its best. It always feels like you\u0027re a bit on-rails and can just go with the flow, complete each room, and get through the dungeon without *really* engaging the brain. There\u0027s no real killer dungeon with a large scale puzzle to solve.\r\n\r\nThen there\u0027s the Temple of the Ocean King. Repeated trips retreading the same ground and bad stealth mechanics make the Temple feel like a real roadbump when you\u0027re otherwise having a good time with the game. And that\u0027s not to mention the Ghost Ship combining \u0022stealth\u0022 with escorting  slow-walking NPCs.\r\n\r\nAll that complaining knocks Phantom Hourglass down to a 4/5.",

      "notes": "Phantom Hourglass, the previous game, is a game that really leans into the DS\u0027s hardware and as a result plays out very differently from the GBA Zelda titles (e.g. Minish Cap). Yoshi\u0027s Island DS represents the far opposite end of the spectrum, and plays out almost identically to Yoshi\u0027s Island on the GBA. This is interesting as it sets boundaries most DS sequels fall somewhere in between. Some of them are mostly the same with touch screen menus or minor enhancements, and some lean more towards changing it up (but few as drastically as PH).\r\n\r\nAlmost all the action takes place on one screen, with the other extending the field of view up or down (and you can switch which way you\u0027re looking at will). The graphics are upgraded a little from the GBA title but much in the same style, and the gameplay is basically identical.\r\n\r\nThe one major new mechanic is swapping babies. Different babies have different abilities which change up the gameplay a little bit, and you have to swap around occaisionally to solve puzzles. I mostly stuck with Mario when I had a choice as he\u0027s the most versatible.\r\n\r\nA lot of stuff is returning from the previous game. Nothing is directly copied over I think, but the early game seems familiar and there are some things like a boss that\u0027s a remix of a boss from YIGBA. A few segments are very closely borrowed from the first game like one falling rock section. There\u0027s not much outside of the baby mechanic sections that couldn\u0027t have gone in the original game.\r\n\r\nThe sped up the transformation animation which is a minor thing but really annoyed me in the previous game because it was so slow.\r\n\r\nWeird observation: in the original YI after beating a boss you get a big key and open an invisible door to the next world. In this one the key is gone but the door is now visible with a big keyhole.\r\n\r\nI think the game gets kind of bullshit and frustrating towards the end. For some reason they decided the ice world was one that needed bringing back for round 2 as well.\r\n\r\nOverall Yoshi\u0027s Island is solid but feels like it\u0027s mostly a rehash of the original with small tweaks and additions. My enjoyment of it definitely suffered because I\u0027ve only recently played the GBA version.\r\n",

      "notes": "Well I rambled last time about the extremes of DS game ports and the randomizer gods have given me a third interesting data point. Etrian Odyssey is fairly unique as a game that only works as well as it does on the DS, without feeling like a gimmicky use of hardware. Having seperate touch screen and main screen provides the perfect setup for dungeon crawling on the top while mapping on the bottom, and buttons provide the controls you want for the gameplay.\r\n\r\nEtrian Odyssey is a harsh game. Particularly during the first few levels you can easily have a character die or even wipe out if you get unlucky in a single fight. I used emulator save states to smooth this out a bit with extra checkpoints and it improved my experience a lot I think.\r\n\r\nThere are a lot of quality of life features missing from EO1 that must have been added in later games. A lot of the menus are a little clunky, and you can\u0027t even sidestep with the shoulder buttons.\r\n\r\nThe structure of the game is one giant 25 floor dungeon which you progress through pretty linearly. Each 5 floors there\u0027s a boss and then a convenient fast travel point. You do end up retreading floors quite a few times, which gets a little annoying but it does line up with encouraging you to map carefully, so I\u0027m not sure how I feel about it. Interestingly if you die in the dungeon it\u0027s a hard game over, but you do get to save your map data.\r\n\r\nThe game basically needs to balance on a knife edge in order to create a satisfying challenge without falling into being frustrating. I think it mostly succeeds, although the early game can be rough and the balance of different classes isn\u0027t 100% dialled in.\r\n\r\nThere\u0027s a bunch of stuff that\u0027s janky, and the balance of classes isn\u0027t great. I looked up some tips online and that gave me a relatively smooth experience but without that you could easily end up with a dead end party.\r\n\r\nThe environment design gets a little stale. On the one hand, having a giant forest dungeon is fairly unique. Unfortunately the game goes with \u0022forest\u0022, \u0022dense forst\u0022, \u0022blue forest\u0022, \u0022sandy desert forest\u0022 making up the environments for most of the game. To be fair, the 5th stratum does change it up fairly dramatically (with a little bit of forest vibes remaining).\r\n\r\nThe mapping tools are a touch lacking in this installment. In particular one stage is effectively a conveyor belt maze and there\u0027s no way to notate the conveyors. A few other icons in certain places would have gone a long way too.\r\n\r\nThe story is quite light for most of the game but really kicks into high gear right near the end.\r\n\r\nThe final boss is kind of bullshit, and beating it seemed to require a ton of grinding and possibly rejigging my party significantly. I ended up using cheats to get over the line, no regrets.\r\n\r\nOverall, I think Etrian Odyssey manages to pull it off. It has a lot of issues but the core game is there and is good. It went on a little too long but not so long that I rage quit. I know that when we get all the way to the later 3DS titles massive improvements have been made, so I\u0027m interested to find out how the series evolves over 2 and 3 which are part of the DS challenge list.\r\n",

      "notes": "Hotel Dusk is somewhere between a visual novel and a point-and-click adventure game.\r\nIt\u0027s another DS title making some interesting use of the hardware: it\u0027s one of the handful of games that are played with the DS held sideways, \u0022like a book\u0022.\r\nIt uses the touch screen almost exclusively with the only use of buttons to advance text when no other input is needed.\r\n\r\nThe game has not one but two puzzles which hinge on closing the DS lid!\r\nI thought Phantom Hourglass was the only one!\r\nAnother weird hardware thing: there\u0027s a puzzle where you have to press two switches at once.\r\nBut the DS doesn\u0027t support multi-touch, pressing multiple points reads as the average location.\r\nSo the game expects to read you pressing one switch and then jumping to half way between them.\r\nThis was possible on the emulator by manipulating the pause function while moving the touch point.\r\nWeird hack though.\r\n\r\nI said it\u0027s part visual novel because there is a lot of text and dialog.\r\nI got a bit frustrated as the text scrolls in slowly, with no option to speed it up or press a button to advance.\r\nIt\u0027s not voiced, so this just pads out the game when you can read text quicker than that.\r\nI nearly always have text speed set to as fast as possible in games, I\u0027m not sure I know anyone who has it on slower speeds given the choice.\r\n\r\nThere\u0027s a system in the dialog where you can sometimes interrupt when prompted to ask a question.\r\nThis system seemed a bit redundant as I basically always pressed it when given the option, and I think sometimes it would be required to get key dialog.\r\nAlso it always gives you an option of 2 questions but it\u0027s often not clear from the prompt what you\u0027re asking or how the two options actually differ.\r\nIf you fuck up and choose the wrong prompt you\u0027ll often \u0022remember it\u0022 5 seconds after you leave the conversation allowing you to have another swing.\r\nThat\u0027s just annoying really.\r\n\r\nThe point-and-click adventure aspect is fairly light, mainly walking around to find people to talk to with occaisional simple puzzles.\r\nIt keeps it pretty grounded compared to more comedic or out-there adventure games.\r\nMore \u0022find a wire to pick this lock\u0022 than \u0022use this rubber chicked to cross a zipline\u0022.\r\nThere are some touch screen minigames, which work OK aside from a few fiddly ones.\r\n\r\nGraphically the game is pretty good.\r\nThere\u0027s a good mix of static 3D environments that you wander around and this sketchy hand-drawn style for dialog.\r\nCutscenes also make good use of the two screens side-by-side with effects that cross over or with characters facing each other.\r\n\r\nSo a lot of the game rests on the story.\r\nIt\u0027s kind of a noir detective style story.\r\nThe main character, Kyle Hyde, is an ex-NYPD cop who\u0027s looking for a former partner.\r\nHe turns up at the titular Hotel Dusk, and over the course of a single night you uncover the mysteries of his past which turn out to be conveniently linked to a bunch of people at the hotel.\r\nIt\u0027s really a slow burner and fairly focused on characters rather than a wild plot.\r\n\r\nThis game takes a while to get going.\r\nThe main character also has the classic \u0022video game protagonist\u0022 personality where he pokes and pries into everything for no apparent reason, and engages in casual theft, breaking and entering rather than just asking for a hand like a normal human being.\r\nYou spend a fair amount of time early in the game doing fairly boring stuff, like \u0022have dinner\u0022, \u0022find your package that\u0027s been misdelivered\u0022, and \u0022pay your hotel bill\u0022.\r\nI thought the game might kick it up into high gear later but no, past half way in the game and we\u0027re still doing \u0022figure out what wine someone had with dinner so you can give them the label they wanted\u0022.\r\nI keep waiting for a dramatic inciting incident like a murder which has never come.\r\n\r\nThe dialog slips into really exagerated noir detective lingo at times.\r\n\r\nThe climactic puzzle is kind of dumb since it requires you to solve it within a time limit as you\u0027re locked in an airtight room.\r\nBut then solving the puzzle doesn\u0027t let you exit, someone else arbitrarily saves you.\r\nThe whole plot reveals in the last few chapters revolve around the fact the bad guys have hidden elaborate puzzles hiding their secrets in the hotel rather than just... not writing them down anywhere.\r\n\r\nUltimately Hotel Dusk fell a bit flat for me and I wanted to get it over with.\r\nThe story is about equivalent to a single Phoenix Wright case but it\u0027s stretched to an entire game.\r\nThe focus is more on realistic characters but none of them are that interesting or well written.\r\nI can imagine a version of this game that\u0027s good, but Hotel Dusk doesn\u0027t quite get there.\r\n",

      "notes": "Touch Detective is a pretty straight point and click adventure title. It\u0027s one of the lowest metacritic rated games, but I stuck it in (along with the sequel) as I\u0027ve played bits before and I wanted to have a go at experiencing it properly.\r\n\r\nWeak use of DS features generally. Plays out almost entirely on the touch screen with touch based gameplay, but the top screen is almost entirely unused. Basically just has a close up of the main character reacting to events and a label telling you where you are.\r\n\r\nThe gameplay is simple point and click stuff, talk to people (with simple dialogue trees and short conversations), find and examine items, combine them together, and use them to solve puzzles in the world. The design goes off the rails very quickly, and even the first case descends into literal dream logic which makes almost no sense. There doesn\u0027t seem to be a way to solve a lot of things in the game without a lot of trial and error or guide usage. There\u0027s also some acausal behaviour where a character won\u0027t appear to advance the plot unless you\u0027ve hit the right arbitrary triggers to continue.\r\n\r\nStorywise, you play as a young girl who\u0027s inherited her family\u0027s detective agency, and you need to solve 4 cases to be recognised by the Great Detective Society. You proceed to solve the requesite 4 cases at which point the game ends. Nothing too wild going on there but it\u0027s an excuse to have some episodic mysteries to solve.\r\n\r\nGraphically and thematically I quite like the game. It\u0027s got this \u0022dark cartoon\u0022, almost Tim Burtonish style to it which I think works. The story and cases are mostly cute and innocent with surreal twists to them.\r\n\r\nThe game is pretty short with the 4 cases taking roughly the same amount of time rather than lengthening later on. There are only a handful of areas in the game too (even compared to Hotel Dusk\u0027s tiny hotel last time).\r\n\r\nOne particular dialog broke my mind. The \u0022correct solution\u0022 was to say \u0022no\u0022 when asked if you know who did it. Then after a few lines of dialog the main character says they do know who did it and you get to pick from a list of options. wat. That made no sense at all. That was in the 4th case, which might be the most nonsensical of all, with the Circus Master who is like an insane dementia case and the culprit who just pops up and admits it once you\u0027ve smashed your head into a wall.\r\n\r\nOverall, a bit of a lacklustre adventure game, slightly saved by its general style.\r\n",

So here it is, a few games later, thanks RNGesus.\r\n\r\nIt\u0027s a kind of arcade-style action game. It\u0027s split into 2 \u0022phases\u0022. In the first, Baby Mario descends on the top screen and you have to anticipate his fall and draw cloud platforms on the touch screen to guide him past enemies and into coins to score points. Enemies can also be circled to turn them into bubbles which can then be thrown around. Everything is a bit physicsy as Mario, the enemies and coins are all affected by your cloud platforms.\r\n\r\nThen it moves to Yoshi carrying Baby Mario horizontally. You can still draw clouds to move Yoshi around, but mainly you tap to throw eggs at enemies across both screens.\r\n\r\nThe game is just a score attack driven game, with a few modes that vary slightly in how long you play and what the goal is. There\u0027s no way to get to the credits or \u0022beat the game\u0022 that I could see (apart from beating all the built-in high scores). I put it down after playing enough to get a sense of it. Didn\u0027t fall in love with the gameplay, but it\u0027s OK.\r\n",

      "notes": "Ninja Gaiden: Dragon Sword is an adaptation of the Ninja Gaiden series for the DS. Specifically the later 3D Ninja Gaiden games that are more like spectacle fighters rather than the original 2D platformers.\r\n\r\nNinja Gaiden: Dragon Sword is our first instance of contrived subtitles that abbreviate to DS - Ninja Gaiden: Dragon Sword = NG:DS. We\u0027ll be seeing plenty of them in the DS challenge.\r\n\r\nWhen playing, you have the DS oriented sideways again, and control mostly using the touch screen. Touch to run around, slash or tap enemies to attack them, etc. Press any physical button to block. There are some special moves on specific gesture sequences too.\r\n\r\nThe game has some really cool elements like boss fights with big boss enemies and the camera shifting to a closer in perspective. Boss fights felt dramatic and fun generally. The special magic moves feel really powerful and cool to fire off, although the \u0022draw the symbol\u0022 minigame was a bit pointless since you\u0027re not timed or risking damage as you do it.\r\n\r\nThere are some criticisms to make. A lot of the time I felt like I was doing the touch screen equivalent of button mashing and doing just fine in combat.\r\n\r\nCombat also gets fairly repetetive quickly as you\u0027re almost always fighting really large waves of the same few enemy types. Seriously, almost every room will have wave after wave of enemies spawning. I got into the habit of running through a lot of rooms where the fight wasn\u0027t mandatory to progress. Enemy variety over the whole game is ok, but each level only has 3-4 types of enemies present so they get stale within each level.\r\n\r\nOh I should probably mention the game has a story. It\u0027s nothing to write home about, big boobed demon ladies are messing things up and kidnapping your (love interest or sister) (I missed which one it was) and you (a ninja) have to collect some mcguffins and then use the titular Dragon Sword to stop them. It\u0027s an excuse to murder a bunch of demons and enemy ninjas.\r\n\r\nThe game isn\u0027t too tough, there are plenty of save points that fill up your health and magic, and I was able to plough through the game without many deaths. The bosses get tougher later on though.\r\n\r\nHonestly NG:DS exceeded the expectations I formed after I assessed what kind of game it was. It plays out better than I would have thought \u0022spectacle fighter using touch controls\u0022 would. I think it might have ended up better if they had just gone with classic button controls and could have made the game feel tighter and more precise.\r\n",
