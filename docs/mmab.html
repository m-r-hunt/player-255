    <h3>Notes</h3>
    <p>Mega Man & Bass is another Mega Man game, in the original series of Mega Man games. As a running theme from the previous game, it was originally release on the SNES in Japan but not localised, and then later ported to the GBA and released abroad.</p><p><br />The game is pretty similar to the previous Mega Man game I played, Mega Man Zero 4, and most of what I had to say there still applies, so this will mainly be a comparison to that game.</p><p>The story is similarly perfunctory. A robot named King raids the robot museum for designs so he can build a robot army. Then at the end, it turns out he was working for Dr. Wily all along! These games are almost a self parody at this point (even when originally released on SNES it was alongside Mega Man 8, not to mention all the spinoffs like the X series).</p><p>The gameplay is a bit clunkier than the Zero games. There's no wall jumping and dashing is replaced with a slide along the ground. You do get a choice of Mega Man or Bass, who play a little differently. Bass has the ability to aim away from dead horizontal, which seems like technology Mega Man should really get installed.</p><p><br />MMAB is more like a classic Mega Man game than Zero in that it revolves around killing the robot bosses and getting their weapons. I think the game gets better after you have a few weapons under your belt, as you have the ability to deal with situations cleverly, by picking a good weapon, rather than being forced to blast through with the default buster. Each boss is also weak to another bosses weapon. Exactly how weak varies: some are totally trivialised but some remain tricky.</p><p>The ending is a predictable gauntlet, with 2 "final bosses" (King and then Dr. Wily) with multiple stages each, with refights of all the robot bosses in between. I still think this is a lazy way to pad out the game and increase the difficulty (given the lives system in place).</p><p><br />MMAB is certainly not a bad game, but it repeats all the Mega Man tropes ad nauseum, which I'm not a big fan of. Also, on the GBA, I think the Zero series is better.<br /></p>
