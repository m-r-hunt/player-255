    <h3>Notes</h3>
    <p>Ultimate Brain Games is a collection of classic board games made for the GBA.</p><p><br />Yup, this going to be a quick one.</p><p>The games seem competently put together, with a decent variety. They're pretty much what you'd expect: Chess, Checkers, Dominoes, Mahjong Solitaire, etc. Battleships and Connect 4 get non-trademark-infringing versions with slight differences. No complaints here, but also not much to offer in the modern age. There are 1 player vs. AI and 2 player variants (where appropriate). The AI seemed reasonably competent, but might struggle to challenge e.g. hardcore chess players due to the GBA's slow processor speed.</p><p><br />There's a surprisingly detailed avatar/character creator to make your little portrait which is displayed during games. You have to remember the GBA has only local multiplayer, so this seems fairly pointless.</p><p><br />Obviously the game doesn't have a story mode or an ending, so I stopped after trying out the modes.<br /></p>
