    <h3>Notes</h3>
    <p>Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest is an action adventure game based on the popular Pirates of the Caribbean film franchise, which, fun fact, is based on on a ride at Disneyland.</p><p>The game is not the lazy tie in you may have been expecting. In fact, it's a surprisingly good game.</p><p></p><p>Basic gameplay is a side scrolling platformer, with simple sword fighting. This is decent enough, better than a lot of the dodgy GBA platformers. The enemies can be a bit annoying, especially when they're near an edge and block you from getting on it to fight them. It's otherwise decent though.</p><p><br />This is all wrapped in another layer where you sail around the Caribbean in a pirate ship, landing on islands to get to the platformer levels. This was surprisingly cool and in-depth. You can have ship battles when you encounter enemies on the seas. These end up just being annoying, with you sailing around each other in circles, fighting against the wind.</p><p>You can buy upgrades for ship and platformer sections, explore to find bonus treasures, and look for rumours in taverns. It has a nice piratey feel too it. The main quest is fairly short, only taking me a few hours to plough through, but you could probably put in more time to exploring if you wanted to.</p><p>Graphics are decent, a little ugly in places but they are generally clear including platform hitboxes.</p><p><br />Overall, a surprisingly decent tie-in attempt.<br /></p>
