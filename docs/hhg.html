    <h3>Notes</h3>
    Hamtaro: Ham-Ham Games is a track-and-field style sports game, based on the Manga/generally cute franchise of Hamtaro, a cute hamster who has cute adventures, with his cute hamster pals.<br />
<br />
<br />
There's another Hamtaro game on the GBA which is quite different which we'll get on to at some point.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
It has a very simple plot: the hamsters are holding a tournament, and you control Hamtaro and his team of friends as they try and beat a couple of other teams, most notably the Seahams, a pirate hamster team (which I found to be an excellent concept). That's about it for story.<br />
<br />
For the gameplay, as you might expect, it's essentially a bunch of minigames for the different sports on offer. They mostly revolve around time button presses, with some approaching a rhythm game (notably the synchronized swimming). They all seem to function well enough, but the difficulty seemed to vary widely. Some were hilariously easy, but I lost others. In the main "story" mode, you only get one shot at each event (aside from practice) and have to stick with your results.<br />
<br />
<br />
My favorite was the carrot pulling, and least favorite were the two "tournament sports", tennis and volleyball. The bird-back riding (think equestrian) would have been good, but the collisions seemed a bit off especially on gates oriented side-on to the camera. The others were all fine, more or less.<br />
<br />
You can wander around the tournament grounds between events, talk to other hamsters (for simple and slightly amusing dialog), and find sunflower seeds (which you also get by winning events). I think the only use for these was buying cute costumes which didn't really appeal to me.<br />
<br />
Just playing through the events and getting to the end didn't take too long. I ended up winning about 2/3 of the gold medals overall, enough to win the tournament as a whole.<br />
<br />
The high point of the game by far is the art. Gorgeous pixel art and animations abound throughout the game. There are a lot of unique cute hamsters in this game.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Overall, a nice enough game if a little simple, saccharine sweet, and short.<br />
