    <h3>Notes</h3>
    <p>So Puchi Puchi Virus is firmly in the &quot;I had no idea what this game was&quot; category. It's an arcadey puzzle game where you have to form triangles of coloured viruses on a hex grid, and set off big chain reactions to score big points.</p><br />
<p>The core mechanic is OK, but not quite good enough to really warrant as much game as we got here.</p><br />
<p>The story and writing were surprisingly good, with a solid dose of weird humour and a few references thrown in. Each &quot;patient&quot;/level has a few lines and a backstory thrown in for good measure, and the cutscenes that break up the gameplay were kind of funny.</p><br />
<p>The game is strutured around 102 patients (levels) which you have to cure 90 of to finish the game. Each one has a unique win condition, except there's a lot of &quot;the same one but with different numbers&quot;. Almost all of them are just &quot;score x points in 3 minutes&quot; or &quot;create x chains of length y&quot;. It gets pretty repetetive. Also, late on the game stopped giving me cases and I had to figure out that randomly playing practice mode would unlock the last few cases.</p><br />
<p>I burned through Puchi Puchi Virus pretty fast, I had some fun with it but I can't see myself playing it again.</p><br />
