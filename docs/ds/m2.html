    <h3>Notes</h3>
    <p>This is an FPS. I'd never heard of it before. Quite well made, technically impressive. Run around, shoot enemies, explore with some light metroidvania elements. Bit of a story about discovering an alien base that has been abducting humans and using them to make alien crack. Strong hidden gem energy, main negative points are repetetive environments and slight overuse of the gameplay elements.</p><br />
<p>Sadly I encountered a game breaking bug where a car I was supposed to be using to drive through a timed suggestion did not spawn. I checked a walkthrough video and it's definitely supposed to be there. Possibly triggered because I previously parked in the wrong place before a later cutscene. No way to restart the level or rollback save. I was too far in/the game was not good enough for me to restart at this point, but I'm filing this as &quot;Other&quot; because it's not my fault for giving up.</p><br />
