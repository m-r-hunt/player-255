    <h3>Notes</h3>
    <p>Yoshi's Touch &amp; Go is the only other Yoshi-based game, which I did not mark as being in a series with Yoshi's Island DS. So here it is, a few games later, thanks RNGesus.</p><br />
<p>It's a kind of arcade-style action game. It's split into 2 &quot;phases&quot;. In the first, Baby Mario descends on the top screen and you have to anticipate his fall and draw cloud platforms on the touch screen to guide him past enemies and into coins to score points. Enemies can also be circled to turn them into bubbles which can then be thrown around. Everything is a bit physicsy as Mario, the enemies and coins are all affected by your cloud platforms.</p><br />
<p>Then it moves to Yoshi carrying Baby Mario horizontally. You can still draw clouds to move Yoshi around, but mainly you tap to throw eggs at enemies across both screens.</p><br />
<p>The game is just a score attack driven game, with a few modes that vary slightly in how long you play and what the goal is. There's no way to get to the credits or &quot;beat the game&quot; that I could see (apart from beating all the built-in high scores). I put it down after playing enough to get a sense of it. Didn't fall in love with the gameplay, but it's OK.</p><br />
