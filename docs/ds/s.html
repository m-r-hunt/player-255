    <h3>Notes</h3>
    <p>Scribblenauts is a unique game where you can summon almost any item by typing its name, and then use them to solve puzzles. It's an impressive technical achievement, especially on the DS, as the dictionary of object available is pretty comprehensive and they do generally work how you expect.</p><br />
<p>The game is generally pretty fun. There are a lot of levels, in each one you have some goal to complete by summoning objects and interacting with the environment. You have a lot of freedom to do whatever you can think of, and it mostly works. There are &quot;puzzle&quot; levels where you have to solve a vague clue, and &quot;action&quot; levels where you just have to find a star. I preferred the puzzle levels to the action levels generally.</p><br />
<p>Physics can be pretty janky especially when connecting objects together.</p><br />
<p>I unlocked and completed the final level, but not credits sequence. Not sure if there's another criteria for completing the game but I couldn't find any info. I'm counting this as complete.</p><br />
