    <h3>Notes</h3>
    <p>Might and Magic: Clash of Heroes is a spinoff from the well known RPG/strategy series. This one is a basically match-3 puzzle game, where each puzzle level is a battle against an opponent playing their version of the puzzle. Match units to start them charging up (or create walls), and then after n turns they will fire off, destroying stuff on the opponent's side of the field. It has a story campaign mode which adds light RPG mechanics as you walk around a world map, talking to people, buying units and doing quests.</p><br />
<p>The main problem with the game I saw is that it's very RNG dependant, particularly with how units spawn in at the start of battle. The large &quot;special&quot; units exacerbate this problem as if they land akwardly it can take many moves to &quot;unbury&quot; and then  fire them. This is a problem as moves are very limited and precious, and the big units are also by far the most powerful. This creates a big swing between a pretty easy level or an unwinnable setup. It also means the big units are kind of a double edged sword and not using them (or only using 1 of a possible 2 slots) can be better. Which feels bad, the big units should be big, powerful, and valuable but this gets messed up.</p><br />
<p>The game is divided into chapters where you play as a different faction, get to play with all new units and abilities. This is pretty good as the game moves on right as the progression for a faction is done, and it keeps things fresh.</p><br />
<p>I ran into a big difficulty wall a bit past half way through the game. At the end of the Necropolis chapter, the game starts giving the AI big advantages (free elite/champion units charging up on the first turn). I found this really hard to deal with, and only managed to get past using the &quot;revive after death&quot; artifact. Then the final boss of necropolis seemed really tough. I don't know if there was some strategy I should have been using or if I just needed to have mastered the puzzle mechanics at a much higher level. Nothing in the game seemed particularly hard before that point. Maybe my under-use of the bigger units was finally catching up and I should have been getting really good at charging up the big 2x2 champion units. However to even start doing that I'd need to go back and do a bunch of grinding to level them up at that point.</p><br />
<p>Side note: walls always seemed really bad, and could do almost nothing against high level units (ex. 5 power walls when the enemy champions are firing with ~50-100 power). I almost never tried to make walls, only getting them as a side effect of chaining multiple units together. Not sure if I missed something there.</p><br />
<p>Anyway, long story short, I ran into a difficulty wall and am skipping as I don't want to try and bash my head against it any longer. It's a bit of a shame as I was getting quite into the game before that. It definitely exceeded my expectations.</p><br />
