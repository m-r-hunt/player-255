    <h3>Notes</h3>
    <p>TWEWY is a great game, one of my favourites. I had some weird timing as I had just finished the sequel (unrelated to the DS challenge) shortly before starting it for the challenge. This meant I was a bit less enthusiastic than I might otherwise have been, but I got there in the end.</p><br />
<p>TWEWY smashes so many JRPG conventions and replaces them with unique systems. Some of these work really well, some of them fall a little flat. The 2 screen battling has never quite felt really good and I think the remake version does it better. The scanning replacing random battles and drop rate system is just so much better than any other RPG.</p><br />
<p>The story and setting are just so good. If you've never played TWEWY and you're reading it, go play it. Preferably the switch remake version.</p><br />
