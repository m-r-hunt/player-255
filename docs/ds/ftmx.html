    <h3>Notes</h3>
    <p>This is a weird one, that I had not played before. The closest comparison is probably to Warioware, although in Feel the Magic the minigames are a bit more involved, and arranged in a sequence with the narrative to tell the story. However they remain deeply surreal and crazy, feature unicyle chases and escaping from the inside of a snake and all sorts of other whackiness.</p><br />
<p>The game is pretty fun in general. There were just a handful of minigames that didn't land for me and were frustrating to get past. Sometimes you have choices of which game to play and can skip ones you don't like, but you're often forced to play the single option available.</p><br />
<p>The game has a pretty strong visual style which I think has aged quite well. A &quot;remaster&quot; of this game would not need to do much other than render the polygons in high detail with antialiasing. The music is pretty good too. The story follows a man who falls in love with a woman, and proceeds to join a stunt team to impress her, and ends up battling a purple-mohawked-nemesis for her affections.</p><br />
<p>Overall, a fun little game, if short and with some flaws.</p><br />
