    <h3>Notes</h3>
    <p>This is an interesting one. No knowledge of it before going in.</p><br />
<p>You play a mad scientist who interacts with the world by constructing monsters and sending them out into the countryside. You control the monsters walking around a node-based world map and get into fights, which are 1v1 turn-based battles with inidividual limb targetting. Collect parts and complete quests, and then use the parts to make new monster parts to make stronger monsters.</p><br />
<p>The game loves both pre-rendered cutscenes (I think compressed down from the home console versions) and minigames. So many minigames. The controls are a bit weirdly split between buttons and touch screen, can't quite decide what it wants to be.</p><br />
<p>The big fatal flaw of this game which lead to me rage quitting it, is that every time you make a new monster part, a key element of the gameplay loop, you have to do a 1 minute long unskippable minigame. You do the same minigame each time for each element/monster part, and they were easy and boring <em>the first time</em> I did them. Really can't imagine playing a whole game of them. Shame as this does have some interesting ideas and could have been good with some relatively small tweaks.</p><br />
