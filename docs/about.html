	<h3>About</h3>
	Here's what I originally had to say in April 2017:
	<div class="quote">
	<h3>Intro to the Challenge</h3>
	<p>I'm going to play through 255 of the best games for the GBA. That's 4.9 years at a rate of 1 game/week. I'm not sure whether that's a good estimate yet.</p>

	<p>To get the list, I took the games with >=70 score on Metacritic, filtered out some games in genres I don't enjoy (mainly sports simulators and serious racing games). That conveniently came out to 255, and since that's a significant number in gaming, I decided to make that the title/theme of the challenge. Here's the finished list.</p>

	<p>This self-challenge was inspired by internet sites like CRPG Addict, who is playing every CRPG ever made in chronological order, and NESMania, where speedrunner "TheMexicanRunner" beat every NES game ever made. I wanted to do something similar for GBA, but (according to Wikipedia) there are over 1000 GBA games, which made playing them all a bit much. So instead I came up with my arbitrary challenge list via the method above.</p>


	<p>I've skimmed over the list and here are some thoughts:</p>

	<p>Score 90-100 - 14 Games: All classics, and I've played all of them except for the THPS games (and I've played the PlayStation editions of those). Any of these and I'm having a great time frankly, it's really hard to argue with any on this list.</p>

	<p>Score 80-89 - 75 Games: Not quite so consistent, but a lot of strong titles especially in the upper half of the bracket. There are some titles on this list that I'm not looking forward to as much though.</p>

	<p>Score 70-79 - 166 Games: Now we're getting into a real mixed bag. I know there are some games that I personally love down here that are flawed or lack mass appeal. I'm hoping to find some hidden gems that I don't know about too. However I know there are also going to be some fairly bad games and games that don't appeal to me personally in the mix too. Looks like there are a lot of tie-ins in this list, it's hard to get excited about "Noddy: A Day in Toyland" for example.</p>

	<h3>General Rules</h3>

	<p>I'm aiming to at least beat the main story and see the credits of each game. Where that's not applicable for whatever reason (non-story based games for example) my goal is to see the majority of the content on offer to get a good feel for the game.</p>

	<p>As a minimum floor I'm going to spend at least 2 hours on the game minimum before giving up, but I would hope not to invoke that clause too often. This may be applied for some games like the "arcade collections" that appear, or other games without well defined ends.</p>

	<p>I'm not limiting myself to that however, if I'm motivated to keep playing or 100% a game I will.</p>

	<p>No cheats (unless they're given inside the game itself). Avoid the use of FAQs/guides as much as possible, although I will resort to them if I'm irretrievably stuck.</p>

	<p>Each game is selected randomly from the list after I'm done with the previous one (I've written a little program to do this for me).</p>

	<p>First Game</p>

	<p>The first game coming up is The Legend of Zelda: The Minish Cap. This wasn't randomly picked, because playing it was part of the inspiration to undertake this challenge! The completion post for that should be coming up soon.</p>
