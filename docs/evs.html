    <h3>Notes</h3>
    <p><p>This is a tie in game for a dodgy action film, which has been converted into a pretty bad Doom-style FPS.</p><br><p>Although the 3D FPS gameplay technically impressive for the GBA, it's ultimately inferior to Doom or Duke Nukem, both of which are struggling on the GBA. Combat is awkward, mainly due to the scarcity of ammo. Often the level design excerbates this by e.g. only giving you ammo for the godawful sniper rifle or the questionable grenades. </p><br><p>It starts off ok but becomes kind of bullshit later in the game as levels are filled with very tough enemies while you are struggling for ammo for any of the weapons that are really effective against them. Ended up rage quitting quite late in the game on a level where you are forced to use the aforementioned terrible sniper rifle.</p><br><p>Levels try to introduce some variety but often end up being annoying. One level, for example, has the "rival agent" character following you around, unkillable, for the whole level, forcing you to attempt to sprint around mowing down enemies to reach the exit, while the awkward controls make life painful.</p></p>
