    <h3>Notes</h3>
    <p>This is a slightly odd genre - I guess &quot;action adventure&quot; would be the best description. You hop around the levels, Frogger-style, and have to get to the end.</p><br />
<p>First the good - the game is relatively short and doesn't drag things out too much. Each level generally has some unique elements, and they are spread out over a variety of worlds (albeit the video game default jungle/ice world/lava world/etc). There is some inventive design at times.</p><br />
<p>On the bad side, is that you always die in one hit. Any slipup will lead to your immediate death. And of course, there are lives and too much death gets obnoxiously punished by resetting the whole level. Checkpoints are occaisionally too widely spaced excarbating this. All collectibles only lead to getting more lives and they are fairly generous. This does mean I wasn't very motivated to explore off the beaten path.</p><br />
<p>If you ripped out the life system and made the collectibles actually collectible, this would be elevated to a pretty fun game I think.</p><br />
<p>Finally the bosses aren't great - generally just endurance and reaction tests.</p><br />
