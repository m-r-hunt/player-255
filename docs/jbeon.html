    <h3>Notes</h3>
    <p>James Bond 007: Everything or Nothing is a top down Action-Adventure game, based on the media juggernaut that is James Bond. It's actually not based on a film, but is an original story made for games.</p><p><br />There have been good James Bond game adaptations. Goldeneye on N64 is the most famous one, being an early console FPS (and thus a lot of people's first introduction to the genre) as well as titles like Nightfire. This GBA adaptation is... not the best.</p><p><br />The story is typical James Bond stuff, not great literature but it gets the job done. There's a bad guy trying to use nanotechnology to take over the world, and 007 trots the globe tracking him down, gets the girl and saves the day.</p><p>Gameplay isn't great. There's some emphasis on stealth, with enemies patrolling and a detection meter. It's typical "stand behind the wall until the guy walks past" stuff. You can stealth kill enemies, but actually getting it to work is fiddly. Most of the time it's kind of easier to blast your way through, when the game isn't telling you that stealth is mandatory. Speaking of which, gunplay is terrible. Guns kind of auto aim, for you and the enemies, so it's just a case of trying to fire first and hoping the enemies go down quickly. There's some rappelling down walls which would be cool, but the combat is even worse when you're doing that.</p><p>You're trying to complete objectives in each level, which most often boil down to "walk to a place and maybe press a button". Some levels have weird jankiness too, like the lab level where you can't shoot too many scientists even though they can attack and follow you around the whole level. 007 also has some gadgets which are mostly kind of ineffectual. You can buy upgrades between missions with little noticeable effect. Really you just want health packs to avoid dying. There are some driving sections for variety, which work a little better but get repetitive fast.</p><p>Graphically the game looks pretty bad. It's trying too hard to be realistic and just looks muddy and understylised. Character designs are super boring too. Try and guess which character is James Bond in this screenshot.</p><p>(It's the guy on the right for reference). The best thing I can say is each level has unique graphics, which is better than some games.</p><p>It's fairly short, without too many levels, so at least it was over quickly.</p><p>Overall, nothing about EoN is heinously bad, but it's pretty uninspired and nothing was really fun about it.<br /></p>
