    <h3>Notes</h3>
    <p>I was trying to beat this, but I ran into a hard wall. It's a straightforward action RPG. However I reached a point where I had apparently built my character wrong (not enough accuracy) and couldn't reliably land hits on skeletons. I was then faced with a level that contained a massive wall of skeletons you have to fight through and no other option, and couldn't make it through despite some attempts and grinding. What's worse is that I used my healing items, they do not return after death, and there was no shop available to buy them as you can't go backwards to previous areas. So, this game seemed decent but it's not super well balanced.</p><br />
